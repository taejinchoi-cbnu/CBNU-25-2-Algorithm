# Algorithm [5118013] (25-02)

## 강의 개요
The lecture covers the fundamental theories and algorithms that must be studied by people in the
computer science field.
The students are expected to have programming skills to implement the algorithms and supposed to have
taken the data structure course.
The students taking this class are supposed to use open source compilers such as GNU C/C++ and the
algorithm contests will be conducted on the Domjudge.																							

## 학습 목표
- The students can explain the definition of algorithms and how to analyze the efficiency of algorithms.
- The students can understand and explain the classical algorithm development strategies such as
divide-and-conquer, greedy algorithms, and dynamic programming with some representative algorithms.
- The students can implement the algorithms with a programming language.
